Is your hand tiller putting a damper on your gardening hobby? Maybe your weeding sickle is not removing weeds as efficiently anymore? 
Cutting or pruning with dull blades often results in damaged branches.  The rips, tears, and lacerations that this cause can make your garden susceptible to disease.  

### Garden Tools Sharpening And Care 

* Rinse your digging tools with a garden hose and use a wire brush to clean the dirt of of them prior to storage
* Give your pruners, loopers, and shearers a quick scrub with warm soapy water
* If your garden tools are exposed to diseased plants or infested soils, give them a quick wash in bleach-diluted water to kill any bacteria
* Avoid using petroleum products on your hand tools to not introduce contamination into the soil
* Keep disinfecting wipes handy to remove any sap, bacteria, or fungus from your hands and tools for a quick clean up
* Store tools in a dry, well ventilated area.  Smaller tools can be stored inserted into a bucket of sand.  Larger tools should be stored hanging up.
